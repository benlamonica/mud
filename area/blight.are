Edge of the Blight~
    The air here is much more humid than in the borderland kingdom of Shienar
to the south, each breath is a labor, taxing your strength as you move through
the area.  Trees still grow here, corrupted and twisted by the Shadow that lays
heavily across this cursed land.  Decay and disease surrounds you on all sides
as you realize you are far from the Light.  To the north you can see what
remains of Malkeri, swallowed by the Blight, it's Seven Towers broken by the
hands of The Dark One.

Entering the Blight~
    The corrupted trees of the Blight sway in the wind, leaves and branches
seeming to grab at you as you pass by them.  Your nightmares seem like fanciful
daydreams compared to the evil that has seized this land.  Only fools and
highly trained Warders enter this far into the Blight, and even the Warders
deadly skills are sometimes not enough to keep them alive.  A little further to
the north lie the Towers of Malkeri, surrounded by almost a hundred small
lakes.

Near the Seven Towers~
    You stand only a few miles from the Seven Towers of the once great Malkeri.
Lakes surround the entire area thier waters dark and cloudy, so dark they seem
to swallow the light around them, seeming to reel and bubble moving the shadowy
water to small waves.  This far into the blight live creatures that could
easily kill a dozen heavily armed Bordermen, creatures created by the Dark One
to watch over his land.

Among the Seven Towers~
    You now ride along the bases of the Seven Towers, once the kingdom of
Malkeri held back the tides of Shadowspan relentlessly seeking to crush the
lands to the south.  It's power now broken the Towers are in ruins, lying on
top of the foothills leading to the Mountains of Dhoom, all but two are utterly
destroyed, the two standing towers are to the east and west.  The taint of the
Shadow is much heavier now, you feel the evil now living in Malkeri. All the
trees and plants in this area are only barely holding on, decay taking them as
quickly as they grow.  Waves roll along the Hundred Lakes, and hope is far
away.

Entering the Blight~
    You have stumbled across a scouting party of Trollocs.  A small fire burns
in the center of the camp.  They appear to be preparing to enjoy a Trolloc
delicacy, you stomach wrenches as you realize what they are devouring.  They
turn about sensing an intrusion of thier meal...

feed has long since rotted away.  The only exit from this room is to the south,

where they made thier last stand against the Trolloc invaders.  The skeletons
of humans and Trollocs alike litter the floor.  You notice with respect that
the Malkeri must have killed three Trollocs for every man that died after a

door, reinforced with iron bars, smashed now into kindling.  To the east and
west are two small doors, probably guard rooms, while to the south you see a
massive iron portcullis, still intact, and rusted completely shut, it's opening
mechanism either destroyed by the defenders of the tower, or possibly it's

The Center~
    You are in the center of a large yard.  Around the yard people dressed in
strange clothes move about.  Some of them look at you for a moment and move on,
others do not even notice you and move by the glass surrounding you without a
care.  Other beings are in the glass yard with you...

Tarwin's Gap~
    You have reached the beginning of Tarwin's Gap.  The largest pass in the
Mountains of Dhoom.  Many great battles have taken place in this gap.
Traditionally the Malkerians defended this gap.  Once that that kingdom fell
the duty fell to the borderland kingdom of Shienar.  You see more than a fist
of Trollocs camped in the gap.  Going further to the north would be suicide.
With the Dragonwall to the east, and the Mountains of Dhoom to the north, you
must turn back.

on to the south and east with all of it's death and decay strong in your mind.
To the north lay the Mountains of Dhoom, that few men have travelled north of,
and even less have returned.  But, what lies to the west is perhaps the most
disturbing of all.  You are standing on the shore of the Dead Sea.  It's black
and lifeless waters are perfectly still like a huge mirror of pollished
obsidian.  It's calm and lack of life chill you to the bone, surely one step
into those evil waters would mean your death.

A Warded Glade~
    You didn't even see this area from the south!  It is not a lucious garden,
but then again, there are actually some green plants here, as well as a spring
flowing with appearantly untainted water.  You can now see the ancient looking
wards suroounding the glade.  Perhaps they were laid buy Lews Therin himself
or one of the Hundred Companions.  Whoever did it, you are just happy to be
here, safe from the horrors of the Blight.
