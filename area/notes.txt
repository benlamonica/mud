Subject Quest Fix~
Text
I fixed it so if you quit in the middle of a quest, it will tell you how
much time you have until your next quest when you come back on.

It works this way. If you quit out of a quest, and you have 10 minutes
left to complete the quest, when you log back on, you'll have to wait
40 minutes until your next quest (the normal 30 + the 10 that were in the
last quest).

Now you can stop complaining :).

The next thing in will be the board system, along with some other new skills
and spells.

Enjoy!

-Tybalt

I put log all on because the mud was crashing for strange reasons.
and if someone that isn't logged does something, there's no way of 
figuring out what caused the problem. So... yeah it's spammy, so
I'd leave wiznet secure off. :)
