the Ancient Mariner~
the Ancient Mariner~
A wizened old man looks up with burning eyes at your entrance.
~
It is an ancient Mariner,
And he stoppeth one of three.
'By thy long grey beard and glittering eye,
Now wherefore stopp'st thou me?
 
The Bridegroom's doors are opened wide,
And I am next of kin;
The guests are met, the feast is set:
May'st hear the merry din.'
 
He holds him with his skinny hand,
'There was a ship,' quoth he.
'Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard loon!'
Eftsoons his hand dropped he.
           ---Coleridge, "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" ll. 1-12

a great white shark~
A huge, sleek klling machine churns the water as it comes for you.
~
An awesome tribute to the evolution of the perfect predator, the great white
shark cruises in constant motion, its keen sense of smell picking out the
slightest taint of blood on the water and its sensitive ears homing in on
the slightest vibration, leading it to easy prey.  Its trapdoor mouth is
lined with row upon row of razor-sharp teeth, tilted inward to catch and
consume, and its tiny eyes are lit with a cold, terrifying dispassion.

by the passing of the centuries and the creeping growth that covers everything

expression is one of fierce pride and wise purity.  Apparently, too, her
sculptor was unsatisfied with carven adornments, for she wears real jewelry.

and a bloody froth spatters down his chin where he gnashes his lips with his
own skewed tusks.  His sausage-like fingers are tipped with ebon talons three
inches long, which throw sparks as he furrows the stone walls in a ceaseless,
futile effort to widen them enough to fit his bulk.

a Man of Leng~
A short humanoid with furry goat legs and little horns is here.

"They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet, and seemed to wear
a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns.  Of other clothing they had
none, but most of them were quite furry.  Behind they had dwarfish tails,
and when they glanced upward he saw the excessive width of their mouths.
Then he knew what they were, and that they did not wear any wigs or
headpieces after all."

"I think their predominant color was a greyish-green, though they had white
bellies.  They were mostly shiny and slippery, but the ridges of their backs
were scaly.  Their forms vaguely suggested the anthropoid, while their heads
were the heads of fish, with prodigious bulging eyes that never closed.  At
the sides of their necks were palpitating gills and their long paws were
webbed.  They hopped irregularly, sometimes on hind legs and sometimes on
four...their croaking, baying voices...held all the dark shades of expression
which their staring faces lacked."

the dark blobs became recognizable as heads...  There were human heads
bobbing and nodding from the gray sea, uncountable thousands of them, but
by far the greater number of the heads were not human...  The heads lived.
Their eyes stared with awful agony; their lips writhed in soundless laments;
tears coursed down the sunken cheeks of many.  Even the horribly inhuman
heads---bird-like, reptilian, monstrous things of living stone and metal
and vegetable matter---showed traces of the unceasing torment that gnawed
at them.

the dark young~
the Dark Young of Shub-Niggurath~
An enormous writhing mass stands sentinel.
~
"Something black in the road, something that wasn't a tree.  Something big
and black and ropy, just squatting there, waiting, with ropy arms squirming
and reaching...  It came crawling up the hillside...and it was the black
thing of my dreams---the black, ropy, slimy jelly tree-thing out of the
woods.  It crawled up and it flowed up on its hoofs and mouths and snaky
arms."

the Great Old One Quachil Uttaus~
A queer, stick figure mummy tilts his head slightly toward you.
~
"It was a figure no larger than a young child, but sere and shriveled as
some millennial mummy.  Its hairless head, its unfeatured face, borne on a
neck of skeleton thinness, were lined with a thousand reticulated wrinkles.
The body was like that of some monstrous, withered abortion that had never
drawn breath.  The pipy arms, ending in bony claws, were outthrust as if
ankylosed in the posture of an eternal dreadful groping."

A palpitating mass of living darkness rises from the floor.

musky, and nauseating.  The disk lifted inexorably, and a little finger of
blackness crept out from beneath its edge...a great wave of iridescent

"A darksome form, big as a crouching man but with long spider-like
members...  He saw that there was a kind of face on the squat ebon body, low
down amid the several-jointed legs.  The face peered up with a weird
expression of doubt and inquiry; and terror crawled through the veins of
the bold huntsman as he met the small, crafty eyes that were circled about
with hair."

...In those grisly eyes were mirrored all the unholy things and vile secrets
that sleep in the cities under the sea, and that skulk from the light of day

unhallowed ritual and sadism and blood had evoked from the silence of the
hills, leered and blinked down on its bestial worshipers..."

And the mass stirred a little at his approach, and put forth with infinite
slothfulness a huge and toad-shaped head.  And the head opened its eyes very

slits of oozing phosphor in the black browless face."

"He saw why the shadow on the frosted pane yesterday had been headless,
and he screamed.  As the desk was thrust aside by the towering naked figure,
on whose surface still hung rags of the tweed suit, Strutt's last thought
was an unbelieving conviction that this was happening because he had read
the Revelations...but before he could scream out his protest his breath was
cut off, as the hands descended on his face and the wet red mouths opened
in their palms."

~
"A body shaped like a broad-based, truncated cone.  A flat, blunt, wedge-
shaped, vaguely reptilian head surmounts this conical torso, and the head is
almost entirely hidden behind swirling tresses.  This hair, or beard and
mane, consists of thickly carved and coiling ropes, like serpents or worms...
Through this repulsive Medusa-like mane of ropy tendrils, two fierce,
serpent-like eyes glare in a horrible intermingling of cold, inhuman mockery
and what I can only describe as gloating menace."

the sky split; deep clefts opened through which darkness began to ooze, a
darkness blacker than the night, which crawled down as a set of slimy
tentacles, taking on more form, more definite shape...  Something was
standing, outlined against the black sky, something which had tentacles of
darkness and a green-glowing eye."

A spiny thing like a huge sea-urchin rolls forward on pyramidic treads.
~
"From an oval body protruded countless thin, pointed spines of multi-colored
metal; at the more rounded end of the oval a circular, thick-lipped mouth
formed the center of a spongy face, from which rose three yellow eyes on
thin stalks.  Around the underside of the body were many white pyramids,
presumably used for locomotion.  The diameter of the body must have been
ten feet at its least wide...long stalks [were] twisting above it...  [The]
shape towered, pulsing and shaking with deafening vibration...  A spine
stiffened toward [a victim]."

rlim shaikorth~
the Great Old One Rlim Shaikorth~
A vast white worm coils supine, gore dripping ceaselessly from eyeless sockets.
~
"Something he had of the semblance of a fat white worm; but his bulk was
beyond that of the sea-elephant.  His half-coiled tail was thick as the
middle folds of his body; and his front reared upward from the dais in the
form of a white round disk, and upon it were imprinted vague lineaments.
Amid the visage a mouth curved uncleanly from side to side of the disk,
opening and shutting incessantly on a pale and tongueless and toothless maw.
Two eye-sockets lay close together above the shallow nostrils, but the
sockets were eyeless, and in them appeared from moment to moment globules
of a blood-colored matter having the form of eyeballs; and ever the globules
broke and dripped down before the dais.  And from the ice-floor there
ascended two masses like stalagmites, purple and dark as frozen gore, which
had been made by this ceaseless dripping of the globules."

Night.  ...He hath naught to do with life and sunlight, but loveth the
blackness and the eternal silence of the abyss, yet He can be called to

whose face was a mass of feelers, a scaly, rubbery-looking body, prodigious
claws on hind and fore feet, and long, narrow wings behind.  This thing...

The stuff of this garment at first seems to be the sheerest of silk, so black
in hue its folds are difficult to discern.  But then, gazing longer upon it,
you begin to make out a subtle play of light within.  Slowly, you realize
that it is the surface of a field of nightmares...in it, stars wink on and
are snuffed out...lovers meet and part...mothers and children weep in the
darkness...amorphous shapes flit between worlds, terror and despair in their
wake.  At long last you are able to drag your gaze away again, only to feel
a chill hand upon your heart.

The water surrounding you is a deep, transparent blue.  Your visibility
here is quite limited, but you can see a little.  Dimly seen figures cruise
by, the ripples of their wake caressing your face.  Over your head, the
water lightens toward the surface, and deeper yet below you, you think you
can make out a faint phosphorescent gleam.

Before the Coral Reef~
The faint silvery glimmer visible from above opens out below you like the
leaves of an arcane tome.  A vast coral reef, glowing an eerie, muted silver,
spreads as far north and south as the eye can see.  Marine life thrives all
around you: giant sea anemones, schools of iridescent fish, great twining
strands of kelp, beds of molluscs as wide as a Great Hall, tiny jeweled crabs
waving clicking pincers.  In the deep water all around, larger creatures make
themselves known, not entirely to your liking.

The proportions of the coral reef are larger than life, larger even than you
would have expected, looking upon it from above.  A flat surface has formed
here, home to a rainbow display of reef creatures.  Coral spires rise all
around you to the north and south, and to east and west the reef shelves
downward into black depths that incite an instinctual fear in the back of
your mind.

in an abrupt cliff, and black, murky water is all you can see.  The shadows
of some huge creatures cruising just out of your limited sight make you think
that perhaps you shouldn't go that way.  Coral spires rise to the north and

You walk as through a vast undersea forest.  Giant sea anemones stretch forth

mighty ropes of kelp wave a thousand thick jewel-green fronds.  Towers of
coral rise over all, spikes driven upward by the tiny organisms of the silver
reef, stretching for the surface and, perhaps, their cousins, the unseen
stars.

You can see a great swathe of the phosphorescing coral reef, with its forests
of kelp and giant sea anemones, dotted with the small, contrasting figures
of brightly colored fish.  The view would almost be refreshing if the waters
did not seem a somehow oppressive atmosphere.  It serves to remind you that

of kelp and encrusted in barnacles.  Through a large hole you can see what

the aft windows, which look out on a wonderland of undersea life, and a
richly appointed bunk rests against one wall.  As you enter, a translucent

plants seem to prefer higher elevations, but various sea creatures are still
very much in evidence, feeding perhaps on plankton that you cannot see.  Some
distance to the east, the coral reef appears to drop off abruptly.

At the Brink~
The coral reef ends rather suddenly here.  At eye level to the east, you can
see only murky water.  The glimmering coral rises to the west toward the main
body of the reef.  At the edge of the escarpment, a huge, ancient ship anchor
has been overgrown by the patient living coral, aided by layers of algae
and seaweed.  A huge chain is attached to one end of the anchor, and it hangs
down over the brink.

Clinging to the Anchor Chain~
The heavy iron chain is slick in your grasp, coated with algae and a fringe
of seaweed.  You inch slowly along the coral cliff face, your way illuminated
by its silvery phosphorescence.  Far below you, the sea floor is a vague
shadow, and above, you can see the shaft of the giant sea anchor protruding
over the escarpment.

The Base of the Coral Cliff~
You feel by the water pressure around you that you are not yet deep, deep
within the sea, but the utter blackness of the water around you is
discomfiting nonetheless.  In the dim light given off by the phosphorescent
coral, you can see a wide-gauge chain coiled in a loop here, and stretching
upward along the cliff face.  Seaweed grows in scraggly patches upon jumbled
rock and sand.

Trapped!~
Sure enough, after scrabbling down to this ledge on the cliff face, you
realize that you can't climb back out.  Black water is all you can see to
the east, the unyielding cliff face to the west, and spurs of rock to north
and south.  Peering down past the ledge you rest on, you see nothing but a
deadly fall; and no matter how hard you try, you can't get back up to the
ledge that you came from.  Life's a bitch, ain't it?

the skeletons and husks of thousands of tiny creatures, and as you look down
in horror and disgust, you notice black-scaled serpents only as long as your

the heart of the continental shelf.  The play of currents on your face reveal
the open water to the east.  Scanning the walls in hopes of discovering some
hitherto unknown detail, you can't help but notice several long, deep gouges
in the living rock, as though some wild beast has been here, trying to REND,
TEAR, and CLAW his way out.

floor in this strange hollow.  Mixed in among them are the bones and tiny
exoskeletons of other creatures.  A rocky chasm in the bottom of the

note that it appears to be a submarine volcanic flue.  Just thinking about

Almost before you can take a breath, a vast curtain wall of green-slimed
basalt looms out of the murk before you.  So high you can barely glimpse
the embattled ramparts overhead, and so broad the sinister stonework
disappears from sight in both directions.  But what truly chills your
heart are the great gates.  Inscribed with twisting hieroglyphics and
hideous, shrieking faces, they almost seem to writhe in animate lifelessness
under your gaze.

The Ramparts~
Nothing more than a low rim of stonework edges the ramparts on the inside
wall, allowing you to see easily down into the sunken city in all its putrid
green glory.  The stones are slippery underfoot, making you grasp at the
crenellations along the outside edge of the ramparts for support.  In the
gaps between battlements, you can see the eerie wall of black water held
away from R'lyeh by some unseen force.

Climbing the South Tower~
The steps on the spiral staircase are slick, and if there ever was a banister
it has long since disintegrated, forcing you to pick your way carefully.  The
tower narrows as it reaches upward, and as the walls draw closer the stench
of ozone and creeping death intensifies until it is an almost palpable
miasma.

Summit of the South Tower~
This is one of the two highest points in R'lyeh.  Gazing across the sunken
city, you can just make out the north tower in the darkness.  The stench
rising up from the draperies of moss and slime covering the basalt stonework
all around you is enough to make you light-headed.  Just below the tower,
the terraced hill that dominates R'lyeh ends in a flat-topped landing.
