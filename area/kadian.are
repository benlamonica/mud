continuously drenches you.  A large pile of bones, compiled of mostly fish, lie
here decaying and creates cloy rotting smells.  The creature that lives here

Lair of The Earth Dragon~
    The room is alight from magma that bubbles in a few locations in the room
that reflect off the multitude of different stones in the room.  Earth, sand,
mud and rock are also seen around the room in varying mixtures.  Strange dull
sounds eminate from about the room seemingly from almost all directions.

quarters of someone at one time and you notice the remnants of a finely carved
door that has been bashed to pieces.  Shredded bedding and fabric covered with

room at which are several ornate chairs.  This room looks as if it would be the
main chamber used for holding audience with someone of very high standing.  On
the south wall instead of the normal thorns is the start of an incredibly
massive tree on which it has some unique carvings.

like it might be a bedroom as strange as it is in a tree. Or to the west is the

The Inner Sanctum~
    You are in the inner sanctum of a Magitor.  Each step you take makes a dull
metallic thud.  The metal glows lightly and makes everything look the same to
you.  Exits lie in all directions.

Road to Baerlon~
    The road continues north with a canopy of trees guiding your way.  The road
also leads south.  Small animal noises can be heard to either side of the road
of which some sound like an alarm of some mostly from birds.

    The forest opens up into a small field where you see a small gate standing
in the open.  It's a strange gate made of stone with carvings of leaves about
it.  Towards the ground you see impressions of someone massive who has been

ancient forgotten tower.  The grey bricked floor has prints of some dog
creature all over it and those prints seem to be burned into it.  High above
you is a beautiful chandalier unlit for centuries.  A circular staircase lies
near the north wall leading up.

    This tower does not seem to go very high because you have already reached
the top.  Dust again covers the room except for one interesting item on the
north wall which has not been touched by any dust.  The object seems to be
built into the wall and makes an arch of sorts.  Through the arch you can see
only darkness.  You stick your hand though the wall and you could swear your
hand is no longer part of your body and quickly pull it back.

Edge of a Volcano~

    Precariously balanced you stand on the edge of an erupting volcano.  Hot
lava spews past you on either side nearly hot enough to sear your flesh.  Your
hair singes as burning ash lands on it.  The lava floods the entire plain below
you burning a swath of destruction wherever it touches.

    Eyes seem to bore into you from every empty window around you.  You stand
in the center of a strangely desolate crumbling city.  This is the city that
trollocs avoid, this is Shadar Logoth.  Unconsiously your fingers tremble as
you look for the nearest exit to leave this dreadful place.  Wind like ice
wraps itself around your body chilling you and making a horrid whistling sound
as it whips through the dead city.

    There is no order here at all.  Only Chaos.  Wind whips in every direction
with hail and brimstone whipping by as well.  The ground beneath you threatens
to fall beneath you and the air you breath tries to solidify.  The area around
you lacks any form it is as if you are in the time and place before creation.

the desk before you is a small journal with the name Michiko stamped into it.
You are standing in the White Tower where it may almost be as dangerous as
walking naked in the Blight.
