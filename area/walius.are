You are on a path that leads to the forest.  The air is much cooler here
and apart from the pine needles crunching under your feet, the only sounds
you hear are the songbirds somewhere overhead.  Light from the sky above you
splashes through the canopy of massive pine trees illuminating the path. 
The path leads back to the east and west.

a majestic black dragon, slaying a three-headed beast.  A pixie floats above
the battle, casting spells to aid the fearless pair.

Misty Lair~
You have reached a dead end in the passage.  The whole area is covered in
a mist making it difficult to see.  The floor is covered with the remains of
fish and the odd lake bird.  Most have been stripped clean.  Huge claw marks
mark the walls as if some large beast has been fighting here.
