Sym~
A lithe jester frolicks in the shadows.

A cartwheeling flurry slows momentarily to resolve itself into a slim,
green-clad figure crowned by a tassled jester's hat.  Stitched in gold
across the right and left breast pockets you notice the words:
"Sym"
and
"To wonder is to grow"
The left pocket is partially tinted with grass stains.

belong to the present.

at things with no apparent plan or reason..  Surprisingly, the garden looks
well cared for, although those shears he's waving around look sort of lethal 
to anything living that might get in the way..

and
"Myrl"

zdreni avenger assassin figure~
the Zdreni avenger~
A darkly clad figure watches you, a cruel smile playing across its lips.
~
A slender dark elven form stands before you, eyes glimmering with a
strange, cruel light which seems to glow in the darkness like twin flames.
The avenger is among the best in blade, stealth, and magic of the clan
and is sworn to destroy all who spill the blood of a Zdreni clan member.
Considered beyond the rank structure and fierce competition among
the clan members for status, the avenger is extremely loyal to all members
of the clan.  Shimmering above the collarbone is the form of a stooping
hawk over two crossed daggers.

is the leader of the Zdreni guild and extremely powerful, both because
of the influence of his position and his ability to retain it despite
the power games of those below him.  The image of two crossed daggers
shimmers above his collarbone.

zdreni stalker assassin figure~
the Zdreni stalker~
A silent figure stalks in the shadows.
~
A middle rank assassin, the stalker has trained extensively in the
arts of death.  Increase in status up to this level has been obtained
by consent of the deathmaster, as the assassination of other clan
members while below this rank is cause for immediate death.  Rise in
rank for the stalker from now on will come only through the assassination
of one of higher rank.  Hence, the stalker seeks to hone his abilities
to perfection, for a failed assassination attempt means instant death,
and those above him are anything but strangers to the art.

mark gabrian white insignia hair~
an inscription is woven in gold around edge of the mark:

  Take my hand
  and fear no longer
  Take my hand
  and cry no more..

  Reaching into the icy darkness
  and for an instant
  a glimmer of laughter
  emerges from the depths of memory
  to brush his heart,
  before flickering away,
  leaving traces
  like threads of gold
  shimmering warmly in the darkness.

  Picking up the threads,
  he weaves them together --
  Together my friends.
  Forever my friends.

  And against the deepening darkness
  Echoing in my ears,
  The golden roar of a lion.

* CHANGES (since the older version - the lower level version is unchanged)
* area now takes up 200 vnums (drakyri isle was moved to 11800-11899)
* added zdreni assassin guild to shadows area
* revised equipment stats (lowered most. the really nice (crimson) eq in the
*  zdreni area is _extremely_ difficult to get, even for a level 100 player
*  (hitroll for avengers w/ crimson eq is 5, damroll 10 above normal.
*   world limit 1 on oath)
