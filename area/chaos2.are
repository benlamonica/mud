Path to Chaos~
	You walk on a very dangerous path. This is the path to Chaos. A 
path that not too many walk down. This path is dark and eerie. You wonder
if you will ever return from this path. The trees on both sides seem to
be alive and trying to grab you. The earth upon which you walk seems to
be waiting for your corpse...

The Cave of Fate~

illumination of thousands of stars glowing from a nonexistent ceiling. You
seem to be in a different realm. This may be your last chance to leave this
place alive!

The Hall of Mirrors~
	You suddenly find yourself in a brightly lit room surrounded
by hundreds of people. You feel dizzy and disoriented, and the last 
thing you remember is the feeling of being somehow pulled into that
hideous reflection. As your eyes adjust to the brightness, you realize
that you are actually in a room filled with mirrors, and the other
figures you thought you saw are only reflections.

Room of Adjustment.~
	In contrast to the Hall of Mirrors, this room is gloomy and
dark. As your eyes adjust to the dim and misty light radiating from
the walls, you see a very large room. Your attempts to orient yourself
to your surroundings are cut short by the sight of movement in the far
corner.

	This huge rectangular room is hung with pictures of Drow, lined up
along all the walls. All of the dark elves appear to be wearing the same
clothing: a plain, unadorned tunic. There is a door in the west wall directly
opposite your position, and there seems to be something written on the

through the mist you can see that the room is filled with glowing green
webs. You have no time to ponder the significance of these observations,

Ghostly Temple~
	This area was obviously a temple, and there is still a massive
altar against the center of the north wall. Midway between the altar and
the other three walls, the room is divided on three sides by massive floor
to ceiling columns. It is lit by two huge braziers, which burn with a 
flickering purple flame, even though no fuel is visible, and appear to give
off no heat. In fact, this room is noticeably colder than the hallway from
which you just entered. The room is huge, and there appear to be no exits
other than the doorway behind you.

in pools of steaming water. It seems strangely pleasant and quiet here. 
Two stairways exit through the north wall, one on the west and one north.
On the floor before each of the staircases is a strange marking.

A Pleasant Refuge~
	This room is immense and looks like a park. The lighting is warm and
subdued, like a spring evening. The ground is covered with a green mossy
growth that seems soft enough to fall asleep on, and there is even a fountain
with a statue of a centaur. The pillars supporting the roof have been carved
into the shapes of nymphs and naiads, and the entire room looks completely
inviting.

students of Chaos. There are large desks for privacy and paper magically
floats in the air for special notes. The shelves here are made of pure gold.
This room looks like it is used quite a bit to study in, even now! There 
are thousands of books here. A tome of Chaos, a scroll of Chaos and a book 
of Chaos lie on the floor here.
(look tome, look scroll, look book to read these.)

shop is unlike any you have ever seen in your life. All along the walls are
Pictures of the most Famous people of Chaos. You look up and notice that 
there isn't a ceiling! What you see instead sends shivers down your spine.
You see an immense black sky that stretches for eternity. You see stars and
Huge winged black Dragons in the sky. Many swirling lights, the portals of
Chaos, hang in the air. You feel dizzy by the immense blackness. Beware

apparently carved out of a single huge block of stone. It faces outwards,
torwards the door you entered. The separated bones of a single human skeleton
drift lazily in midair above the seat of the throne, shifting about in an
endless jumble. The skull moves but is always facing outwards and turning
to look at you; the only bones that are not part of this endless, silent
slow dance are the intact feet of the skeleton. These are on the floor, 
positioned as if the skeleton is sitting on the throne.
			A small note lies at the skeleton's feet.

The Haze~
	A blue haze seems to rise before your very eyes, silently and
rapidly, OBLITERATING the world around as you stare at the cryptic 
inscription. The inscription seems to consist of a number of names
and other nonsense, followed by the last line, glowing in deep blue
common lettering: "If you're reading this, of course, its too late." 
Blue radiance is everywhere; you are lost and floating somewhere not
quite real. Blue, shifting light is under, over, and all around you. 
The light begins to fade, and you realize that your legs and feet are
colder- and wetter- than the rest of you. You're somewhere else, all
light goes black and you are standing in inky, dark water as deep as your
thighs. A faint purple light comes from your left. Ahead of you, in the
distance, you hear the water rippling as something within it moves...

A Cozy Room.~
	The warm, muted glow of two hooded lamps illuminate this cozy room.
Furs cover the floor, and old, massive smoothly carved wooden furniture
lines the walls. The furniture consists of a large eating table, a sideboard,
three large reclining chairs woth foot-stools, and a high stool and a desk.
Two shelf units are also along the walls, home to bright displayed weapons
and a few thick books. On the far wall is a fireplace, a merry blaze 
crackling within it. It is surounded by an ornately-carved stone mantel
depicting armored human knights riding dragons and competing with elven
knigts on Pegasi. Overhead, the dragon- and Pegasi-riders motif is repeated
on the carved panels of the ceiling. Brass cloak-hooks project from a
human-sized arch of richly polished wooden panelling just inside the door.
The arch-topped panel contains a fold-down wooden bench, and is carved 
with a large, complex scene of birds singing over a pool where a unicorn
bends its head to drink. You don't hear anything but the faint crackle
of the fire.

does not feel empty. If you are quiet, you can almost hear the murmuring
of many voices in the misty gloom. There are decorative carvings on the

and of fights with dragons. You feel completely at home here. Then one

Supply Office.~
	You stand in a large room. A counter runs down the center of this
room. There area is well lighted and the counter has small holes, almost 
like inkwells, at intervals along it. This is where the students would
come and check out various weapons.

Armour Storeroom.~
	This room has falling racks containing pieces of nearly every
sort of armour, from rotting leather to corroded pieces of plate. There
is even a heap of debris to the north that looks as if it were once a
rack of shields. The remnants of armour may have once been neat and 
orderly. Now they are scattered as if a great wind had struck this room.

Projectiles Room.~
	The contents of this room are even more decrepit and deteriorated 
than what you have already seen. This room is full of rotted racks 
holding the decayed remnants of missile weapons. Obviously the components
of bows and slings are more perishable than those of swords and armour.
As you stand surveying the residue, an old rusted dagger flies by, narrowly
missing your head!

"So you think you are strong enough to best me? I know that is why you
have come to this place. And that is why I have been waiting here for you.
For I am Stephan. Stephan, do you hear? The very name should make you
tremble with fear. You silly little wretch will soon feel the power that
is mine to command! For mine is the only way. If you seek to leave this

Amazing Room of Magic.~
	This room has pictures on the walls which seem to move of their own
volition. They are pictures of mages, each in the act of casting a spell.
Some of the spells you recognize, lightning bolt, fireball, but some are
completely outside your experience. The pictures seem to run through a 
sequence in two or three minutes then begin again. Each time that the 
pictures change though, the scene is slightly different: a variation in
background, a different mage casting the spell, etc.
