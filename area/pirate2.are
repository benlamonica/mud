The frozen captive is so gratified by your kindness that
she tells you a story. ` A long time ago, Lok started this
area, and had major writers block. Well, Simba sort of
nudged him and he broke out of his block. With Rainman
doing the main debugging and alot of dark beer, this
area was created for your amusement. The secret to sailing
is that all simple seas never border on grounding reefs.
If you are in shallows type exit after each move to look
for shoals ( they wont show in the night ). There is a main
clockwise current running in the high seas, so don't sleep
on the high seas, or you will drift.. There are alot of
clues throughout isles so don't just powermud and miss all.
Lok charmed me so you wouldn't just mindlessly butcher me.'
P.S. I can also heal you.

inscription strange rock~
Carved into the rock in wizard runes is the following:
` BEWARE-Enchanted Lodestone: I was on holiday on this
deserted island, practicing on my enchantment spells,
when in the middle of casting, I was rudely interrupted by
a mystic summons. The interruption threw my spell off target
and onto the island itself. With a wrenching crunch the whole
island rose from the sea to the position you find it now.
Intrigued by the phenomena I took a sample of the rock back
to my shack in the Forest Arden, where I determined by
methods of alchemy that the island had rich deposits of
lodestone, which when subjected to enchantment magic, flies.
I have used this discovery to create several floating trinkets
which impart the ability of flying to the recipient. Beware
for I know not how long this enchantment will last. - MERLIN'

with a thunderous roar into the frosty sea. You think you can make out

You feel warmth returning to your bones, and you welcome the quiet
splendor of the ice interior. Next to you in the cave are several triremes
anchored at bay. You anchor and hop down onto the hard packed ice,
following a trail of footprints to a dead end passage. Puzzled, you get on
your hands and knees, and feel the outline of an ice trap door beneath you.

At the Bonfire in the Great Ice Cavern~
You stand next to a roaring bonfire in the great ice cavern. Logs some ten
feet in length are stacked crosswise to a height of 5'. The flames warm and
light the cavern, and most importantly, your backside. Bedrolls are cast
about the fire, and primitive shelving has been carved into the surrounding
stalagmites. The heat from the fire is so great that it has melted the ice into
a pool of water.
