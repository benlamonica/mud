   As cranes go over sounding their harsh cry,
     leaving the long streak of their flight in air,
     so come these spirits, wailing as they fly.

tiny fangs. She twines forward in a strangely graceful sidestep, revealing her
lower body, huge jointed limbs encased in gleaming black exoskeleton and a
reticulated tail arching forward over her, spike glossed with poison. But it
is her eyes which immobilize you...deepset, glowing crimson like dying embers,
they transfix you as the Gorgon moves in for the kill.

   My eyes were fixed on him already. Erect,

     and smoking sepulchres to that great figure,
     and he said to me: 'Mind how you speak to him.'
   And when I stood alone at the foot of the tomb,
     the great soul stared almost contemptuously,
     before he asked: 'Of what line do you come?'

the Hound of Hell~
A slavering hound leaps toward you through the trees.

A hound it was, an enormous coal-black hound, but not such a hound as mortal
eyes had ever seen. Fire burst from its open mouth, its eyes glowed with a
smouldering glare, its muzzle and hackles and dewlap were outlined in
flickering flame. Never in the delirious dream of a disordered brain could
anything more savage, more appalling, more hellish be conceived than that
dark form and savage face which broke upon us out of the wall of fog.

   The filthy prototype of Fraud drew near

   His face was innocent of every guile,

     and under it his body was half reptile.
   His two great paws were hairy to the armpits;
     all his back and breast and both his flanks
     were figured with bright knots and subtle circlets:
   never was such a tapestry of bloom
     woven on earth by Tartar or by Turk,
     nor by Arachne at her flowering loom.

   What kingliness moves with him even in Hell!
     It is Jason, who by courage and good advice
     made off with the Colchian Ram. Later it fell
   that he passed Lemnos, where the women of wrath,
     enraged by Venus' curse that drove their lovers
     out of their arms, put all their males to death.
   There with his honeyed tongue and his dishonest
     lover's wiles, he gulled Hypsipyle,
     who, in the slaughter, had gulled all the rest.
   And there he left her, pregnant and forsaken.
     Such guilt condemns him to such punishment;
     and also for Medea is vengeance taken.

   this is no dip in the Serchio: take your look
     and then get down in the pitch. And stay below
     unless you want a taste of a grappling hook.'
   Then they raked him with more than a hundred hooks
     bellowing: 'Here you can dance below the covers.
     Graft all you can there: no one checks your books.'
   They dipped him down into that pitch exactly
     as a chef makes scullery boys dip meat in a boiler,
     holding it with their hooks from floating free.
                                                      (XXI: 49-60)

   When he saw me there, he began to puff great sighs

     counselled the Pharisees that it was fitting
     one man be tortured for the public good.
   Naked he lies fixed there, as you see,
     in the path of all who pass; there he must feel

   One of the damned came racing round a boulder,

     upon the ground, the dust rose of itself

A headless figure lurches along with the other Sowers of Discord.

   I saw it there; I seem to see it still -
     a body without a head, that moved along

   It held the severed head by its own hair,
     swinging it like a lantern in its hand;
     and the head looked at us and wept in its despair.
   It made itself a lamp of its own head,
     and they were two in one and one in two;
     how this can be, He knows who so commanded.

   And there I saw another husk of sin,
     who, had his legs been trimmed away at the groin,
     would have looked for all the world like a mandolin.
   The dropsy's heavy humors, which so bunch
     and spread the limbs, had disproportioned him
     till his face seemed much too small for his swollen paunch.
   He strained his lips apart and thrust them forward
     the way a sick man, feverish with thirst,
     curls one lip toward the chin and the other upward.

   His face, it seemed to me, was quite as high
     and wide as the bronze pine cone in St. Peter's
     with the rest of him proportioned accordingly:
   so that the bank, which made an apron for him
     from the waist down, still left so much exposed
     that three Frieslanders standing on the rim,
   one on another, could not have reached his hair;
     for to that point at which men's capes are buckled
     thirty good handspans of brute bulk rose clear.
   'Rafel mahee amek rabi almit,'
     began a bellowed chant from the brute mouth
     for which no sweeter psalmody was fit.

Satan~
Satan, huge and monstrous, towers out of the ice.
~
   With what a sense of awe I saw his head
     towering above me! For it had three faces:
     one was in front, and it was fiery red;
   the other two, as weirdly wonderful,
     merged with it from the middle of each shoulder
     to the point where all cverged at the top of the skull;
   the right was something between white and bile;
     the left was about the color that one finds
     on those who live along the banks of the Nile.
   Under each head two wings rose terribly,
     their span proportioned to so gross a bird: 
     I never saw such sails upon the sea.
   They were not feathers - their texture and their form
     were like a bat's wings - and he beat them so
     that three winds blew from him in one great storm:
   it is these winds that freeze all Cocytus.
     He wept from his six eyes, and down three chins
     the tears ran mixed with bloody froth and pus.

Threads of blood trickle from among dozens of tiny serpents. They are in
constant motion, sliding around and through knots formed of themselves and
their brethren, fixing beady emotionless eyes upon you, forked tongues
flickering, red mouths opening in tiny fanged yawns. They seem to miss nothing
that goes on around them. Sudden motions draw their attention in a ripple of
slender bent necks. They nip irritably at one another and anything else that
comes within reach.

The Far End of the Valley~
   But at the far end of that valley of evil
     whose maze had sapped my very heart with fear!
     I found myself before a little hill
   and lifted up my eyes. Its shoulders glowed
     already with the sweet rays of that planet
     whose virtue leads men straight on every road,
   and the shining strengthened me against the fright
     whose agony had wracked the lake of my heart
     through all the terrors of that piteous night.

     I WAS RAISED HERE BY DIVINE OMNIPOTENCE,
     PRIMORDIAL LOVE AND ULTIMATE INTELLECT.

     ONLY THOSE ELEMENTS TIME CANNOT WEAR
     WERE MADE BEFORE ME, AND BEYOND TIME I STAND.

The Joyless Beach of Acheron~
   But all together they drew to that grim shore
     where all must come who lose the fear of God.
     Weeping and cursing they come for evermore,
   and demon Charon with eyes like burning coals
     herds them in, and with a whistling oar
     flails on the stragglers to his wake of souls.
   As leaves in autumn loosen and stream down
     until the branch stands bare above its tatters
     spread on the rustling ground, so one by one
   the evil seed of Adam in its Fall
     cast themselves, at his signal, from the shore
     and streamed away like birds who hear their call.

   a grief breathed out of untormented sadness,
     the passive state of those who dwelled apart,
     men, women, children - a dim and endless congress.
   And the Master said to me: 'You do not question
     what souls these are that suffer here before you?
     I wish you to know before you travel on
   that these were sinless. And still their merits fail,
     for they lacked Baptism's grace, which is the door
     of the true faith you were born to.'

The Second Circle~
   I came to a place stripped bare of every light
     and roaring on the naked dark like seas
     wracked by a war of winds. Their hellish flight
   of storm and counterstorm through time foregone,
     sweeps the souls of the damned before its charge.
     Whirling and battering it drives them on,
   and when they pass the ruined gap of Hell
     through which we had come, their shrieks begin anew.
     There they blaspheme the power of God eternal.
   And this, I learned, was the never-ending flight
     of those who sinned in the flesh, the carnal and lusty
     who betrayed reason to their appetite.

   'My son,' the Master said, 'the City called Dis
     lies just ahead, the heavy citizens,

   And I then: 'Master, I already see
     the glow of its red masques, as if they came
     hot from the forge to smolder in this valley.'
   And my all-knowing Guide: 'They are eternal
     flues to eternal fire that rages in them
     and makes them glow across this lower Hell.'
   And as he spoke we entered the vast moat
     of the sepulchre. Its walls seemed made of iron
     and towered above us in our little boat.

Path Along the Cliff Face~
   The scene that opened from the edge of the pit
     was mountainous, and such a desolation
     that every eye would shun the sight of it:
   a ruin like the Slides of Mark near Trent
     on the bank of the Adige, the result of an earthquake
     or of some massive fault in the escarpment -
   for, from the point on the peak where the mountain split
     to the plain below, the rock is so badly shattered
     a man at the top might make a rough stair of it.

   I saw an arching fosse that was the bed 
     of a winding river circling through the plain
     exactly as my Guide and Lord had said.
   A file of Centaurs galloped in the space
     between the bank and the cliff, well armed with arrows,
     riding as once on earth they rode to the chase.

     bore poison thorns instead of fruit. The track
   of those wild beasts that shun the open spaces
     men till between Cecina and Corneto
     runs through no rougher nor more tangled places.

Top of the Waterfall~
   A little way beyond we felt the quiver
     and roar of the cascade, so close that speech
     would have been drowned in thunder. As that river -
   the first one on the left of the Appennines
     to have a path of its own from Monte Veso
     to the Adriatic Sea - which, as it twines
   is called the Acquacheta from its source
     until it nears Forli, and then is known
     as the Montone in its further course -
   resounds from the mountain in a single leap
     there above San Benedetto dell'Alpe
     where a thousand falls might fit into the steep;
   so down from a sheer bank, one enormous
     plunge, the tainted water roared so loud
     a little longer there would have deafened us.

     of the depths of the pit below: a desolation
     bathed with the tears of its tormented crew,
   who moved about the circle of the pit
     at about the pace of a litany procession.

   And when I looked down from their faces, I saw
     that each of them was hideously distorted
     between the top of the chest and the lines of the jaw;
   for the face was reversed on the neck, and they came on
     backwards, staring backwards at their loins,
     for to look before them was forbidden. Someone,
   sometime, in the grip of a palsy may have been
     distorted so, but never to my knowledge;
     nor do I believe the like was ever seen.

     a painted people, weary and defeated.
     Slowly, in pain, they paced it round and round.
   All wore great cloaks cut to as ample a size
     as those worn by the Benedictines of Cluny.
     The enormous hoods were drawn over their eyes.
   The outside is all dazzle, golden and fair;
     the inside, lead, so heavy that Frederick's capes,
     compared to these, would seem light as air.

     merges into the swelling of the haunch,
