Guarddir 'direction'
  -target
	This trigger will activate when target tries to go the
	'direction'. Unless the continue command is issued, the target will
	not be allowed to leave the room in that directoin.
GuardObj 'objname'
  -target
	This trigger will activate when someone tries to pick a lock on an
	object, or take an object from the room. Good if a mob is guarding a
	treasure of some sort.

variables:
-target
  -hp
  -mana
  -mv

is_holy(target)
is_giant(target)

{All is_* functions return TRUE or FALSE, depending if they meet the req's}

random(var) {returns value between 0 and var, inclusive}
percent()   {returns a number between 0 and 100}
continue

{If statements can be spread on several lines}

defining mob_vars:
bool <name>
int  <name>
string <name>
timer <name>

strings can be set using the = sign. Strings must be stored in ' ' quotes.
To send commands to the mud interpreter, put them in " ". If you wish to
send a variable to the mud interpreter, type "$varname" and the $varname
will be replaced by the value in the variable. To put char vars in, just
do a "$varname.name".

the timer variable, once given a value, will continue to count down after
each tick of the mud.

NOTE: It would be neat to be able to assign mobprogs to PC's. Like a
hypnotism spell.

Format of Mobprog:

#MOBPROGS
#vnum - Coincides with the mobile. Mobile vnum 1234 will have a mobprog if
this number is 1234.
<var> - variable declarations. These are global to the mobile, so they can
<var> - be accessed between triggers.
<var>
<var>
~
<trigger>~ - any trigger from the above. If the trigger doesn't exist,
this is ignored.
Statment - A statment, using any of the above items.
